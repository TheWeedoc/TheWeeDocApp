          <p>
            Thank you for using The Weedoc, services, and features provided to

          <p>
            The Service allows you to upload, discover, watch and share videos
            and other content, provides a forum for people to connect, inform,
            and inspire others across the globe, and acts as a distribution
            platform for original content creators. You can also read all about
            enjoying content on other devices like your television, your games
            console, or any other medium which supports internet, browser and
            streaming services.
          </p>

          <h3>Applicable Terms</h3>
          <p>
            Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, TheWeedoc.com,
            Guidelines, and the Policy, Safety, and Copyright Policies, which
            may be updated from time to time (together, this "Agreement"). Any

            Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand
            it. If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any
            part of it, then you may not use the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            By accepting this Agreement, you affirm that you are 18 years of age
            or above and are fully competent to enter into this Agreement, and
            to abide by and comply with this Agreement. In case you are below 18

          </p>

          <h3>Who may use the Service?</h3>

          <h4>Age Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service; which should
            be enabled by a parent or legal guardian.
          </p>

          <h4>Permission by Parent or Guardian</h4>
          <p>
            If you are considered a minor in your country, you represent that
            you have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the Service.
            Please have them read this Agreement with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor in your country, by
            allowing your child to use the Service, you are subject to the terms
            of this Agreement and responsible for your child’s activity on the
            Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organization,
            you represent that you have authority to act on behalf of that
            entity, and that such entity accepts this Agreement.
          </p>

          <h3>Your Use of the Service</h3>

          <h4>Content on the Service</h4>
          <p>
            The content on the Service includes Videos created by the respective
            creators with limited timeframe by the service provider and per the
            requirements predefined to be time-bounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides
            it to the Service. Weedoc is under no obligation to host or serve
            Content. If you see any Content you believe does not comply with
            this Agreement, including by violating the Guidelines or the law,
            you can report it to us.
          </p>

          <h4>Accounts and Service Handling</h4>
          <p>
            You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for
            Content, without having an account registered within the service.
            However, you do need an account to use some features. With an
            account, you may be able to like videos, create your own videos,
            upload your content, and more.
          </p>

          <p>
            Creating an account will give you access to additional features and
            functions, such as uploading videos, making comments, and more
            (where available).
          </p>
          <p>
            To protect your account, keep your password confidential. You should
            not reuse your account password on third-party applications.
          </p>
          <p>

            if you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or account.
          </p>

          <h4>Your Information</h4>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and
            protect your privacy when you use the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you
            to the Service in accordance with the Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            If any internal or external legal infringement and abuse actions are
            raised against the content posted to our service, it is solely
            liable with and to the creator of the content who is answerable to
            the service and lawsuits if applicable. Our Service will not be
            liable and not answerable in any circumstance to anyone. It is
            solely liable with the creator of the content.
          </p>

          <h4>Permissions and Restrictions</h4>
          <p>
            You may use the Service as made available to you, as long as you

          </ul>

          <h4>Reservation</h4>
          <p>
            Using the Service does not give you ownership of or rights to any
            aspect of the Service, including usernames or any other Content
            posted by others or Weedoc.
          </p>

          <h4>Develop, Improve, and Update the Service</h4>
          <p>
            Weedoc is constantly changing and improving the Service. As part of
            this continual evolution, we may make modifications or changes (to
            all or part of the Service) such as adding or removing features and
            functionalities, offering new digital content or services or
            discontinuing old ones. We may also need to alter or discontinue the
            Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security
            improvements, make changes to comply with the law, or prevent
            illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. These changes may
            affect all users, some users, or even an individual user.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as
            the Weedoc application), that software may update automatically on
            your device once a new version or feature is available, subject to
            your device settings. If we make material changes that negatively
            impact your use of the Service, we’ll provide you with reasonable
            advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing
            abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and
            operability issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content
            from your account which is subject to applicable law and policies.
          </p>

          <h3>Your Content and Conduct</h3>

          <h4>Uploading Content</h4>
          <p>
            If you have an account, you may be able to upload Content to the
            Service. You may use your Content to showcase your artistic skill.
            If you choose to upload Content, you must not submit to the Service
            any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or the
            applicable law(s).
          </p>
          <p>In particular, the Content must:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect the rights of others, including privacy.</li>
            <li>
              Not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted
              material) unless you have permission from that party or are
              otherwise legally entitled to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage
              such abuse or harm), including against children.
            </li>
            <li>Not mislead, be patently false, or defraud.</li>
            <li>
              Not illegally impersonate, defame, bully, harass, be obscene, or
              stalk others.
            </li>
            <li>Not incite violation of applicable laws.</li>
            <li>
              Not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services — for
              example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive
              ways, introducing malware, or spamming, hacking, or bypassing our
              systems or protective measures.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the
            Service. If any legal infringement and abuse actions are raised
            against the content posted to our service, it is solely liable with
            and to the creator of the content.
          </p>

          <h4>Rights you Grant</h4>
          <p>
            You retain ownership rights in your Content. However, we do require
            you to grant certain rights to Weedoc and other users of the
            Service, as described below.
          </p>

          <h5>License to our service</h5>
          <p>
            By providing Content to the Service, you grant a worldwide,
            non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable license to
            use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, prepare
            derivative works, display, and perform it). Our service may only use
            that Content in connection with the Service and its successors’ and
            Affiliates’ business, including for the purpose of promoting and
            redistributing part or all of the Service.
          </p>

          <h5>License to Other Users</h5>
          <p>
            You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide,
            non-exclusive, royalty-free license to access your Content through
            the Service, and to use that Content, including to reproduce,
            distribute, prepare derivative works, display, and perform it, only
            as enabled by a feature of the Service (such as video playback,
            etc.). For clarity, this license does not grant any rights or
            permissions for a user to make use of your Content independent of
            the Service.
          </p>

          <h5>Duration of License</h5>
          <p>
            The licenses granted by you continue for a reasonable period of time
            after you remove or delete your Content from the Service. You
            understand and agree, however, that our service may retain, but not
            display, distribute, or perform, server copies of your videos that
            have been removed or deleted.
          </p>

          <h5>Removing Your Content</h5>
          <p>
            You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also
            have the option to make a copy of your Content before removing it.
            You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights
            required by these terms.
          </p>

          <h5>Removal of Content</h5>
          <p>If we reasonably believe that any of your Content:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Is in breach of this Agreement or</li>
            <li>May cause harm to our service, our users, or third parties,</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to remove or take down that Content in
            accordance with applicable law. We will notify you with the reason
            for our action unless we reasonably believe that to do so:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Would breach the law or the direction of a legal enforcement
              authority or would otherwise risk legal liability for our service
              or our Affiliates.
            </li>
            <li>
              Would compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of
              the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Would cause harm to any user, other third party, our service, or
              our Affiliates.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Copyright Protection</h4>
          <p>
            We provide information to help copyright holders manage their
            intellectual property online in our Service. If you believe your
            copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a
            notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our policies provide for the termination, in appropriate
            circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.
          </p>

            We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension
            unless we reasonably believe that to do so:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement
              authority.
            </li>
            <li>Would compromise an investigation.</li>
            <li>
              Would compromise the integrity, operation, or security of the
              Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Would cause harm to any user, other third party, Our Service, or
              our Affiliates.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Where we are terminating your use for Service changes, where
            reasonably possible, you will be provided with a time limitation to
            export your Content from the Service.
          </p>

          <h4>Effect of Account Suspension or Termination</h4>
          <p>
            If your account is terminated or your access to the Service is
            restricted, you may continue using certain aspects of the Service
            (such as viewing only) without an account, and this Agreement will
            continue to apply to such use.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you believe that the termination or suspension of your account
            has been made in error, you can appeal by writing to us.
          </p>

          <h3>About Software in the Service</h3>

          <h4>Downloadable Software</h4>
          <p>
            When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as
            the The WeeDoc application), unless that software is governed by
            additional terms which provide a license, Our Service gives you a
            personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, and non-exclusive
            license to use the software provided to you as part of the Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and
            enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided in the manner permitted
            by this Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, sublicense,
            or lease any part of the software, unless you have written
            permission.
          </p>

          <h4>Open Source</h4>
          <p>
            Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open
            source, royalty-free license. There may be provisions in an open
            source license that expressly override some of these terms, so
            please be sure to read those licenses.
          </p>

          <h3>Other Legal Terms</h3>

          <h4>Warranty Disclaimer</h4>
          <p>
            Other than as expressly stated in this Agreement or as required by
            law, the Service is provided “as is” and Weedoc does not make any
            specific commitments or warranties about the Service. For example,
            we don’t make any warranties about:

            <li>The content provided through the Service.</li>
            <li>
              The specific features of the Service, or its accuracy,
              reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              That any content you submit will be accessible on the Service.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
          <p>
            Except as required by applicable law, our Service, its Affiliates,
            officers, directors, employees, and agents will not be responsible
            for any loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill,
            or anticipated savings; loss or corruption of data; indirect or
            consequential loss; or punitive damages caused by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies on the Service.</li>
            <li>

            <li>Any interruption or cessation of the Service.</li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Any content whether submitted by a user or service, including your
              use of content.
            </li>
            <li>The removal or unavailability of any content.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This provision applies to any claim, regardless of whether the claim
            asserted is based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal
            theory.
          </p>

          <h4>Indemnity</h4>
          <p>
            To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend,
            indemnify, and hold harmless our Service, its Affiliates, officers,
            directors, employees, and agents, from and against any and all
            claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt,
            and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising
            from:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your use of the Service.</li>
            <li>Your violation of any term of these Terms of Service.</li>
            <li>
              Your violation of any third party right, including without
              limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right.
            </li>
            <li>Any claim that your Content caused damage to a third party.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this
            Agreement and your use of the Service.
          </p>

          <h4>Third-Party Links</h4>
          <p>
            The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online
            services that are not owned or controlled by our service. Weedoc has
            no control over and assumes no responsibility for such websites and
            online services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms
            and privacy policy of each third-party website and online service
            that you visit.
          </p>

          <h3>About this Agreement</h3>

          <h4>Changing this Agreement</h4>
          <p>We may change this Agreement:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To reflect changes to our Service or how we do business – for
              example, when we add new products or features or remove old ones.
            </li>
            <li>For legal, regulatory, or security reasons.</li>
            <li>To prevent abuse or harm.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If we materially change this Agreement, we’ll provide you with
            reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes,
            except:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When we launch a new product or feature.</li>
            <li>
              In urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or
              responding to legal requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove any Content
            you uploaded and stop using the Service.
          </p>

          <h4>Severance</h4>
          <p>
            If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not
            enforceable for any reason, this will not affect any other terms.
          </p>

          <h4>No Waiver</h4>
          <p>
            If you fail to comply with this Agreement and we do not take
            immediate action, this does not mean that we are giving up any
            rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the
            future).
          </p>

          <h4>Interpretation</h4>
          <p>
            In these terms, “include” or “including” means “including but not
            limited to,” and any examples we give are for illustrative purposes.
